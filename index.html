            It is played by two teams made up of 11 players (substitutions are possible due to injuries or tactical reasons). Ten of them can only touch the ball with their feet, legs, body and head; only one, placed to defend the goal (and therefore called "goalkeeper"), can also touch the ball with hands and arms, but only if the ball is in his own penalty area. The objective of the game is to score more points (called goals or goals) than the opposing team by passing the ball over the opposing goal line. The duration of a match is 90 minutes, divided into two halves of 45 minutes each plus any additional time (at the discretion of the match director).
            In the event that the ball ends up outside the pitch, the action is restarted in different ways depending on the team that last touched the ball before it went out and the boundary zone from which it crossed the line.
            When a player commits an infringement, play is interrupted and restarted with a free kick or penalty, depending on the area in which the foul was committed.
